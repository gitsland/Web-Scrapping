# Web-Scrapping 
This Web Scrapping is done in a Google Colab notebook using python which detects words and sentiments to analyze an web page.

I have researched several news/ articles/ blog post on recession in Canada and selected an openion by John Rapley- a political economist, published on "The Globe And Mail" news web site on  JULY 28, 2023. Here he discussed how the recent recession can be utilized as opportunity in long run. Some policies in economic sector should be changed based on strategies of some other countries.

From my web scrapping project, I have generated visualizations which shows- this news article mostly discussed about economy and country to analyze recission and opportunities.
Based on rules based sentiment detection process, I found this article is mostly neutral and positive
